# Facedle
## Facedle is a game where the player has to guess a sequence of three gestures. 
A gesture is just a face the player makes. A sequence is a set of 3 gestures.
The gestures can repeat, but the adjacent ones must only have one difference. The player has three attempts to guess the correct sequence. 
The game also includes a visual game interface, where the player can see the images of the gestures, as well as a principal menu and rules menu.
**Can you guess the sequence of today?**

## The game uses image facial recognition to detect the gestures and is calibrated before the game begins. Just plug in your webcam!
